## StudHub Data Server

## Spinup Database

1. Download [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Run command `docker compose up -d` to run postgres in background.
3. Connect to database with tool at your choice, e.g. DataGrip. Database is running at `localhost:4444`, with postgres
   as both username and password. Database name is studhub_db.

> [!Note]  
> If you have an existed db that has outdated tables, run `docker compose down --volumes` to
> remove existing db first.

### Seed csv file

1. Initial csv file can be generated by running `scripts/create-mapping.py`. (Need to install `pandas` package in Python).
2. Clean duplicate records from generated csv with `scripts/remove-duplicates.py`
3. Copy record from csv with
```bash
docker exec -it studhub_db psql -U postgres -d studhub_db -c "\COPY parts_map FROM './data/parts_mapping_clean.csv' CSV HEADER"
```
